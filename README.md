### Running the App

Start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Note:**  
You need a PeerJS server running on port 3001 for video calls to work.  
You can run your own PeerJS server with:

```bash
npx peerjs --port 3001
```

Or use a public PeerJS server by updating the PeerJS config in `public/script.js`.
